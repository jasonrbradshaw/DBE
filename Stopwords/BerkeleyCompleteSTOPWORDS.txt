therefore sect thought bigger situation meridian elevation horizon farther air variously impregnated sometimes sometimes less vapours exhalations fitted retund intercept rays light follows appearance horizontal moon hath always equal faintness consequence luminary though situation one time judged greater another given true account phenomena horizontal moon suppose farther evident anyone following

open eyes keep shut turn way without doubt similarly depend look flower perceive white rather colour direct open eyes towards part sky avoid seeing sun light darkness effect volition certainly respects altogether passive tell seeing consist perceiving light colours rather opening turning eyes former certainly well since actual perception light colours altogether passive become action said ingredient every sensation doesnt follow concessions perception light colourswhich doesnt involve actioncan exist unperceiving substance isnt plain contradiction dont know think furthermore since

size sensible qualities let think littlei dont find well think possible something might really exist nature implies contradiction conception means therefore since even mind cant possibly separate ideas extendedness motion sensible qualities doesnt follow former exist latter must also exist would seem consequently arguments agreed decisive secondary qualities need extra help count strongly primary qualities also besides trust senses dont convince sensible qualities coexist appear senses place senses ever represent motion shape divested visible tangible qualities neednt say freely admit

sensation cannot exist outside mind doesnt follow object cannot either object mean object senses exactly immediately perceived right explain difference immediately perceived sensation take sensation act perceiving mind beside something perceived call object act example red yellow tulip act perceiving colours tulip tulip talking one see see beside colour shape extendedness nothing would say red

skillful changing subject philonous see dont want push direction lets return distinction sensation object understand correctly hold every perception two things one action mind true action cant exist belong unthinking thing whatever else involved perception may position perception without act mind perception could exist unthinking substance grant impossible perception mind said active produces puts end changes anything mind produce discontinue change anything way except act cannot mind count active perceptions extent volition included pluck flower active handmovement arose volition likewise holding nose either smelling also act draw air nose breathing manner rather otherwise effect volition isnt smelling either would smell every time breathed manner true smelling result plucking holding breathing dont find involved anything plucking holding breathing whatever else happensincluding perceiving smellis independent wholly passive respect different case hylas consider seeing isnt power open eyes keep shut turn way without doubt similarly depend look flower perceive white rather colour direct open eyes towards part sky avoid seeing sun light darkness effect volition certainly respects altogether passive tell seeing consist perceiving light colours rather opening turning eyes former certainly well since actual perception light colours altogether passive become action said ingredient every sensation doesnt follow concessions perception light colourswhich doesnt involve actioncan exist unperceiving substance isnt plain contradiction dont know think furthermore since

equally passions sensations mind may call external objects give words whatever kind existence like examine thoughts tell whether right admit philonous look carefully goes mind find thinking variety sensations cant conceive sensation could exist unperceiving substance hand look different way sensible things considering many properties qualities find suppose material substratum without cant

means nonrelational hylas means doesnt idea represents material substance like conclude exists qualities cant conceived exist without support seems relative notion material substance conceive conceiving relates sensible qualities right tell please relation isnt sufficiently expressed term substratum substance one latin means underneath layer comes latin meaning standing word substratum mean spread sensible qualities true consequently spread extendedness agree nature entirely distinct extendedness tell extendedness quality matter something supports qualities isnt obvious supported thing different supporting one something distinct extendedness including supposed substratum extendedness tell hylas thing spread without extended isnt idea extendedness necessarily included spreading anything suppose spread something else must extendedness distinct extendedness thing spread must consequently every bodily substance substratum extendedness must another extendedness qualifies substratum extendedness must also something spread subsubstratum speak infinity isnt absurd well conflicting said namely substratum something distinct extendedness including yes philonous

every object shouldnt seem follow colours equally apparent none ones see really outer object put past doubt consider following colours real properties qualities inhering external bodies couldnt

philosophers maintain secondary qualities yet far denying matter context philosophers means philosophers scientists make clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities primary secondary primary

philosophers maintain secondary qualities yet far denying matter context philosophers means philosophers scientists make clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities primary secondary primary
