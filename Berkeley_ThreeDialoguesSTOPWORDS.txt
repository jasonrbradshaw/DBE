 three dialogues hylas philonous opposition sceptics atheists george berkeley contents first dialogue second dialogue third dialogue first dialogue philonous good morning hylas didnt expect find early hylas indeed somewhat unusual thoughts taken subject talking last night couldnt sleep decided get walk garden thats good gives chance see innocent agreeable pleasures lose every morning pleasanter time day delightful season year purple sky wild sweet notes birds fragrant bloom trees flowers gentle influence rising sun thousand nameless beauties nature inspire soul secret raptures im afraid interrupting thoughts seemed intent something yes id grateful would allow carry dont least want deprive company thoughts always flow easily conversation friend alone please may share thoughts heart would requested hadnt asked first considering odd fate men ages desire mark common people heaven knows trick thought claimed either believe nothing believe extravagant things world wouldnt matter much paradoxes scepticism didnt bring consequences bad mankind general theres risk men thought spent whole time pursuit knowledge claim entirely ignorant everything advocate views conflict plain commonly accepted principles tempt peoplewho less leisure sort thingto become suspicious important truths ones previously thought sacred unquestionable entirely agree bad effects paraded doubts philosophers fantastical views others felt strongly recent times dropped highflown theories learned universities replacing ordinary common opinions since revolt mine metaphysical notions favour plain dictates nature common sense swear find think ever much better easily understand many things previously mysteries riddles glad find nothing accounts heard please last nights conversation represented someone maintains extravagant opinion ever entered mind man namely thing material substance world seriously believe thing philosophers call material substance made see anything absurd sceptical would reason renounce belief think reject contrary opinion anything fantastical conflict common sense obvious piece scepticism believe thing matter steady hylas turn hold matter areby virtue opiniona greater sceptic maintain paradoxes conflicts common sense believe thing good chance convincing part greater whole convincing must give belief matter avoid absurdity scepticism well content accept true opinion turns agreeable common sense remote scepticism heart since want start arguments plainest things world content hear say tell please hylas mean sceptic mean everyone means someone doubts everything someone doubts concerning particular point regard point cannot thought sceptic agree doubting consist accepting affirmative negative side question neither anyone understands english must know doubting signifies suspense two sides someone denies point said doubt concerning affirms degree assurance true denial makes sceptic acknowledge happen hylas call sceptic deny affirm namely existence matter know may firmly convinced denial affirmation hold moment philonous definition sceptic wrong cant hold man every false step makes conversation say sceptic someone doubts everything added denies reality truth things things mean principles theorems sciences know universal intellectual notions nothing matter denial matter doesnt imply denial agree things think distrusting senses denying real existence sensible things claiming know nothing isnt enough qualify man sceptic throughout dialogues sensible means capable sensedthat visible audible tangible etc well let us see us denies reality sensible things claims greatest ignorance since understand rightly counted greater sceptic desire mean sensible things things perceived senses imagine mean anything else im sorry may greatly shorten enquiry clear grasp notions bear ask question things perceived senses ones perceived immediately include things perceived mediately intervention something else dont properly understand reading book immediately perceive letters page mediately means notions god virtue truth etc suggested mind theres doubt letters truly sensible things things perceived sense want know whether take things suggested perceived sense certainly would absurd think god virtue sensible things though may signified suggested mind sensible marks arbitrary connection seems sensible things mean perceived immediately sense right doesnt follow see one part sky red another blue infer must cause difference colours cause cannot said sensible thing perceived eyesight similarly hear variety sounds cannot said hear causes cannot touch feel thing hot heavy cant say truth correctness feel cause heat weight head questions kind tell sensible things mean things perceived sense senses perceive perceive immediately dont make inferences deducing causes occasions effects appearances things perceive sense entirely business reason context occasion taken equivalent cause two terms separated second dialogue page agree sensible things include things immediately perceived sense tell whether immediately perceive sight anything besides light colours shapes hearing anything sounds palate anything besides tastes sense smell anything besides odours touch anything tangible qualities seems take away sensible qualities nothing left sensible agree sensible things nothing many sensible qualities combinations sensible qualities nothing else heat sensible thing certainly reality sensible things consist perceived something different perceivedsomething doesnt involve mind exist one thing perceived another talking sensible things question real existence one mean existence exterior mind distinct perceived mean real absolute existencedistinct relation perceived heat granted real existence must exist outside mind must tell hylas real existence equally possible degrees heat feel reason attribute degrees heat others please tell whatever degree heat perceive sense sure exists also object occasions greatest well least yes reason holds perceived sense indeed greater degree heat intensely sensibly perceived difference certain real existence greater heat reality lesser isnt fierce intense degree heat great pain noone deny unperceiving thing pain pleasure certainly material substance senseless thing sense perception senseless without doubt cant subject pain indeed cant consequently subject greatest heat perceived sense since agree considerable pain accept say external object material substance material substance sensible qualities inhering great heat exist since agree cannot exist material substance please clear point hold philonous im afraid went wrong granting intense heat pain said pain heat consequence effect heat put hand near fire feel one simple uniform sensation two distinct sensations one simple sensation isnt heat immediately perceived pain true well seeing immediately perceived time fire affects one simple uncompounded idea one idea without parts follows one simple idea immediately perceived intense heat pain consequently immediately perceived intense heat identical particular sort pain seems consult thoughts hylas conceive intense sensation occur without pain pleasure cannot form idea sensible pain pleasure general abstracted every particular idea heat cold tastes smells etc dont find doesnt follow sensible pain nothing intense degrees sensations ideas undeniable fact im starting suspect great heat cant exist except mind perceiving sceptical state suspense affirming denying think definite violent painful heat cant exist outside mind according real existence admit certain body nature really hot havent said real heat bodies say theres thing intense real heat bodies didnt say earlier degrees heat equally real difference greater heat certainly real lesser yes overlooked reason distinguishing plainly see intense heat nothing particular kind painful sensation pain cant exist except perceiving follows intense heat really exist unperceiving corporeal bodily substance thats reason denying less intense heat exist substance draw line separating degrees heat exist mind ones exist outside isnt hard slightest pain cant exist unperceived know degree heat pain exists mind dont think degrees heat pains think agreed back unperceiving capable pleasure pain well isnt warmtha milder degree heat causes discomfort worsea pleasure follows warmth cant exist outside mind unperceiving substance body seems reached position degrees heat arent painful also ones exist thinking substance cant conclude external bodies absolutely incapable degree heat whatsoever second thoughts less sure warmth pleasure intense heat pain dont claim warmth great pleasure heat pain admit even small pleasure enough yield conclusion could rather call absence pain seems merely lack pain pleasure hope wont deny quality state one unthinking substance determined maintain warmth pleasure dont know convince otherwise except appealing experience think cold heat intense degree cold pain feel great cold experience great discomfort cant exist outside mind lesser degree cold exist outside mind well lesser degree heat feel moderate degree heat cold body applied skin must conclude body moderate degree heat cold must doctrine true necessarily leads absurdity certainly isnt absurdity think single thing time cold warm well suppose one hands hot cold plunged bowl water temperature two wont water seem cold one hand warm doesnt follow principles water really cold warm timethus believing something agree absurdity admit seems right principles false since admitted true principle leads absurdity anything absurd say heat fire make point still clearer answer two cases exactly alike oughtnt make judgment ought pin pricks finger doesnt tear divide fibres flesh hot coal burns finger hold pin doesnt contain either sensation causes anything like given agreed tonamely like cases judged alikeyou ought hold fire doesnt contain either sensation causes anything like well since must content give point admit heat cold sensations existing minds still plenty qualities secure reality external things say hylas turns argument applies regard sensible qualities none supposed exist outside mind heat cold proving would quite feat see chance let us examine sensible qualities order tastes think exist outside mind anyone right mind doubt sugar sweet wormwood bitter tell hylas sweet taste particular kind pleasure pleasant sensation isnt bitterness kind discomfort pain grant therefore sugar wormwood unthinking corporeal substances existing outside mind sweetness bitternessthat pleasure painbe hold philonous see deluded time asked whether heat cold sweetness bitterness particular sorts pleasure pain answered simply answered making distinction qualities perceived us pleasures pains existing external objects cannot conclude without qualification heat fire sweetness sugar heat sweetness perceived us fire sugar say say irrelevant talking sensible things defined things immediately perceive senses whatever qualities talking place conversation dont know anything may indeed claim discovered certain qualities dont perceive assert exist fire sugar cant life see serves side argument tell agree heat cold sweetness bitterness meaning qualities perceived senses dont exist outside mind see use holding give cause respect four qualities though must say sounds odd say sugar isnt sweet might sound better bear mind someone whose palate diseased may experience bitter stuff times seems sweet perfectly obvious different people perceive different tastes food since one man delights another loathes could taste really inherent food admit dont know think odours dont exactly fit saying tastes arent many pleasing displeasing sensations conceive possible exist unperceiving thing cannot imagine filth excrement affect animals choose feed smells perceive means cant conclude smells like qualities discussing cannot exist anywhere perceiving substance mind think sounds qualities really inherent external bodies dont inhere sounding bodies know bell struck vacuum sends sound subject sound must air explain hylas air set motion perceive louder softer sound proportion airs motion air still hear sound granting never hear sound except motion produced air still dont see infer sound air motion external air produces mind sensation sound striking eardrum causes vibration passed along auditory nerves brain whereon mind experiences sensation called sound sound sensation said perceived us particular sensation mind sensation exist outside mind certainly sound sensation exist air air mean senseless substance existing outside mind philonous must distinguish sound perceived us sound orin wordsdistinguish sound immediately perceive sound exists outside us former indeed particular kind sensation latter merely vibration air thought already flattened distinction answer gave applying similar case ill let pass sure sound really nothing motion whatever true real sound therefore truthfully said motion may makes sense speak motion something loud sweet piercing lowpitched see determined understand isnt obvious qualities belong sensible sound sound ordinary everyday meaning word sound real scientific sense explained nothing certain motion air seems two sorts soundthe common everyday sort hear scientific real sort dont hear latter kind sound consists motion told tell hylas senses think idea motion belongs sense hearing certainly senses sight touch follow according real sounds may possibly seen felt never heard look philonous make fun views want wont alter truth things admit inferences draw sound little odd ordinary language formed ordinary people use surprising statements express exact scientific notions seem clumsy strange come assure think scored pretty big win casually depart ordinary phrases opinions mainly arguing whose notions furthest common road conflict people general think claim real sounds never heard get idea sound sensecan think merely oddsounding scientific truth isnt something contrary nature truth things frankly dont like either given concessions already made better admit sounds also real existence outside mind hope wont stick admitting colours pardon case colours different anything obvious fact see colours objects objects speak suppose corporeal substances existing outside mind true real colours inhering visible object colour see hah anything visible perceive sight perceive anything senses dont perceive immediately often say tell bear hylas tell yet whether anything immediately perceived senses sensible qualities know asserted nothing want know whether still think corporeal substance either sensible quality made sensible qualities question ask ever thought ask say visible object colour see imply either visible objects sensible qualities else something sensible qualities perceived sight earlier agreed false still think left thesis visible objects sensible qualities conversation taking visible objects corporeal substances reach conclusion corporeal substances nothing sensible qualities may draw many absurd consequences please try entangle plainest things never persuade senses clearly understand meaning wish would make understand since dont want look notion corporeal substance shall drop point please tell whether colours see ones exist external bodies colours ones oh beautiful red purple see clouds really rather think clouds nothing dark mist vapour must admit philonous colours arent really clouds seem distance apparent colours apparent call distinguish apparent colours real ones easily colour appears distance vanishes one comes closer merely apparent suppose real colours ones revealed looking carefully close right closest careful way looking use microscope naked eye microscope course microscope often reveals colours object different perceived unassisted sight microscopes could magnify much liked certain object whatsoever seen would appear colour presents naked eye well conclude cant argue really naturally colours objects contrive artificial ways alter make vanish obviously inferred concessions think colours see naked eyes apparentlike cloudssince vanish one looks closely accurately one microscope anticipate next objection ask whether real natural state object revealed better sharp piercing sight one less sharp former without doubt isnt plain science optics microscopes make sight penetrating represent objects would appear eye naturally endowed extreme sharpness microscopic representation thing regarded one best displays things real nature thing colours perceived microscope genuine real perceived way admit theres something say besides possible clearly true actually animals whose eyes naturally formed perceive things small us see think inconceivably small animals perceive microscopes must suppose totally blind see dont suppose sight use preserving bodies injuries eyesight animals use isnt obvious must see particles smaller bodies present vastly different view object view strikes senses even eyes dont always represent objects us way everyone knows someone suffering jaundice things seem yellow isnt highly probable animals whose eyes see differently structured whose bodily fluids unlike dont see colours every object shouldnt seem follow colours equally apparent none ones see really outer object put past doubt consider following colours real properties qualities inhering external bodies couldnt altered except alteration bodies isnt evident colours object changed made disappear entirely use microscope change fluids eye change viewing distance without sort real alteration thing indeed even factors remain unaltered objects present different colours eye depending angle looked thing happens view object different brightnesses light everyone knows bodies appear differently coloured candlelight daylight add facts experience prism separates different rays light thereby alters colour object causing whitest object appear deep blue red naked eye tell whether still think body true real colour inhering think want know particular distance orientation object special condition eye intensity kind light needed discovering true colour distinguishing apparent ones admit quite convinced equally apparent thing colour really inheres external bodies colour wholly light confirms opinion fact colours less vivid depending brightness light light colours seen furthermore colours external objects could possibly perceive external body affects mind unless acts first senseorgans action bodies motion cant communicated except collisions distant object cant act eye cant enable properties perceived mind plainly follows immediately causes perception colours substance contact eyesuch light light substance tell philonous external light simply thin fluid substance whose tiny particles agitated brisk motion various ways reflected eyes different surfaces outer objects cause different motions optic nerves motions passed along brain cause various states events accompanied sensations red blue yellow etc seems light shake optic nerves result particular motion nerves mind affected sensation particular colour right sensations existence outside mind say colours light since take light corporeal substance external mind light colours immediately perceived us cannot exist outside mind admit motions arrangements certain insensible particles matter colours ordinary sensethat understood immediate objects sightcannot substance doesnt perceive say well give position regards sensible qualities mankind takes colours think like scientists invisible colours business argue suggest consider whether wise discussion like one affirm red blue see real colours certain unknown motions shapes man ever could see real colours arent shocking notions arent open many ridiculous inferences give case sounds admit philonous cant keep longer colours sounds tastesin word termed secondary qualitieshave existence outside mind granting dont take anything away reality matter external objects various philosophers maintain secondary qualities yet far denying matter context philosophers means philosophers scientists make clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities primary secondary primary qualities extendedness shape solidity gravity motion rest hold really exist bodies secondary qualities sensible qualities arent primary philosophers assert merely sensations ideas existing nowhere mind doubt already aware part long known opinion current among philosophers never thoroughly convinced truth till still believe extension shapes inherent external unthinking substances extension could mean extendedness could mean size arguments brought secondary qualities hold also shall think shape extension also exist mind opinion shape extension perceive sense exist outer object material substance animals good reason think shape extension see feel outer object surely think tell hylas think senses given animals preservation wellbeing life given men end dont doubt use animals mustnt senses enable perceive limbs perceive bodies capable harming certainly tiny insect therefore must supposed see foot things size even smaller seeing bodies considerable size even though see themif allonly many visible points cant deny creatures even smaller insect seem even bigger something hardly pick small appear like huge mountain extremely tiny animal agree single thing different sizes time would absurd think said follows true size insects foot size see size insect sees sizes seen animals even smaller say principles led absurdity seem difficulty another point didnt agree real inherent property object changed unless thing alters move towards away object visible size varies one distance ten hundred times greater another doesnt follow size isnt really inherent object admit dont know think soon able make mind venture think freely quality others didnt admit legitimate infer neither heat cold water premise water seemed warm one hand cold isnt reasoning infer size shape object premise one eye seems little smooth round eye appears big uneven angular latter ever happen time find looking one eye bare microscope dont know maintain yet reluctant give extension size see many odd consequences following concession extension isnt outer object odd say things already agreed hope wont put anything odd case wouldnt seem odd general reasoning covers sensible qualities didnt apply also extension agree idea anything like idea exist unperceiving substance surely follows shape mode extension specific way extended idea ofin perceiving imaginingcan really inherent matter whether sensible quality shape sound colour seems impossible subsist something doesnt perceive mention peculiar difficulty must conceiving material substance prior distinct extension substratum extension ill say shortly give point reserve right retract opinion later discover led false step right cant denied shapes extendedness disposed proceed next motion real motion external body time swift slow cannot isnt speed body moves inversely proportional time takes go given distance thus body travels mile hour moves three times fast would travelled mile three hours agree isnt time measured succession ideas minds isnt possible ideas succeed one another twice fast mind mine mind kind nonhuman spirit agree consequently body may seem another spirit make journey half time seems take half example fraction would make point well say according view perceived motions object single body really move swiftly slowly time consistent either common sense recently agreed nothing say solidity dont use solidity name sensible quality irrelevant enquiry use name sensible quality quality must either hardness resistance plainly relative senses obvious seems hard one animal may appear soft another greater force firmness limbs equally obvious resistance feel press body body agree sensation resistance immediately perceive body cause sensation causes sensations arent immediately perceived therefore arent sensible thought settled point admit excuse seem little embarrassed trouble quitting earlier views may help consider point extendedness admitted existence outside mind must granted motion solidity gravity since obviously presuppose extendedness superfluous enquire separately denying extendedness denied real existence right philonous wonder philosophers deny secondary qualities real existence yet attribute primary qualities theres difference accounted isnt business account every opinion philosophers many possible explanations one philosophers influenced fact pleasure pain associated secondary qualities rather primary ones heat cold tastes smells something vividly pleasing disagreeable get ideas extendedness shape motion since visibly absurd hold pain pleasure unperceiving substance men easily weaned believing external existence secondary qualities primary ones see something recall distinction made moderate heat intense heat allowing one real existence outside mind denying rational basis distinction surely sensation neither pleasing painful much sensation one pleasing painful neither kind supposed exist unthinking subject come head philonous somewhere heard distinction absolute sensible extendedness granted large small consist merely relation extended things parts bodies arent really substances still dont say absolute extendedness something abstracted large small particular size shape similarly motion fast slow altogether relative succession ideas minds special cases motion exist outside mind doesnt follow true absolute motion abstracted distinguishes one instance motion extendedness another isnt something sensiblefor instance speed size shape think qualitiesnamely absolute motion absolute extendednesswhich stripped sensible properties features making specific way right say extendedness general motion general say everyone accepts maxim every thing exists particular motion general extendedness general exist corporeal substance need time think think point speedily decided without doubt tell whether able form idea mind im willing let present dispute settled following way form thoughts distinct abstract idea motion extendedness none sensible qualitiesswift slow large small round square likewhich agree exist mind ill capitulate cant unreasonable insist longer something notion frank cannot even separate ideas extendedness motion ideas socalled secondary qualities isnt easy consider extendedness motion abstracted sensible qualities isnt mathematicians handle acknowledge hylas difficult form general propositions reasonings extendedness motion without mentioning qualities sense treat abstractedly pronounce word motion follow form mind idea motion without idea body theorems extension shapes proved without mention large small sensible quality follow mind form grasp abstract idea extension without particular size shape sensible quality mathematicians study quantity disregarding sensible qualities go grounds irrelevant proofs lay aside words contemplate bare ideas think youll find arent pure abstracted ideas extendedness say pure intellect cant abstracted ideas formed faculty since cant form abstract ideas clearly impossible form help pure intellect whatever faculty mean phrase refer setting aside questions nature pure intellect spiritual objects virtue reason god etc say much seems clearly true sensible things perceived senses represented imagination shape size dont belong pure intellect initially perceived senses want surer try see frame idea shape abstracted particularities size sensible qualities let think littlei dont find well think possible something might really exist nature implies contradiction conception means therefore since even mind cant possibly separate ideas extendedness motion sensible qualities doesnt follow former exist latter must also exist would seem consequently arguments agreed decisive secondary qualities need extra help count strongly primary qualities also besides trust senses dont convince sensible qualities coexist appear senses place senses ever represent motion shape divested visible tangible qualities neednt say freely admit unless hidden error oversight discussion herethat sensible qualities alike denied existence outside mind fear may free former concessions overlooked fallacy line argument short didnt take time think hylas take time want go back discussion liberty repair slips made support initial opinion presenting arguments far overlooked think big oversight part failed distinguish sufficiently object sensation sensation cannot exist outside mind doesnt follow object cannot either object mean object senses exactly immediately perceived right explain difference immediately perceived sensation take sensation act perceiving mind beside something perceived call object act example red yellow tulip act perceiving colours tulip tulip talking one see see beside colour shape extendedness nothing would say red yellow coexistent extension wouldnt yes go say real existence outside mind unthinking substance colours really tulip see obvious denied tulip may exist independently mind mine immediate object sensesthat idea combination ideasshould exist unthinking substance exterior minds obvious contradiction imagine follows said namely red yellow tulip saw since dont claim see unthinking substance skillful changing subject philonous see dont want push direction lets return distinction sensation object understand correctly hold every perception two things one action mind true action cant exist belong unthinking thing whatever else involved perception may position perception without act mind perception could exist unthinking substance grant impossible perception mind said active produces puts end changes anything mind produce discontinue change anything way except act cannot mind count active perceptions extent volition included pluck flower active handmovement arose volition likewise holding nose either smelling also act draw air nose breathing manner rather otherwise effect volition isnt smelling either would smell every time breathed manner true smelling result plucking holding breathing dont find involved anything plucking holding breathing whatever else happensincluding perceiving smellis independent wholly passive respect different case hylas consider seeing isnt power open eyes keep shut turn way without doubt similarly depend look flower perceive white rather colour direct open eyes towards part sky avoid seeing sun light darkness effect volition certainly respects altogether passive tell seeing consist perceiving light colours rather opening turning eyes former certainly well since actual perception light colours altogether passive become action said ingredient every sensation doesnt follow concessions perception light colourswhich doesnt involve actioncan exist unperceiving substance isnt plain contradiction dont know think furthermore since distinguish active passive elements every perception must perception pain could painhowever inactive ispossibly exist unperceiving substance think tell frankly arent light colours tastes sounds etc equally passions sensations mind may call external objects give words whatever kind existence like examine thoughts tell whether right admit philonous look carefully goes mind find thinking variety sensations cant conceive sensation could exist unperceiving substance hand look different way sensible things considering many properties qualities find suppose material substratum without cant conceived exist material substratum call tell please senses acquainted sensible properties qualities perceived senses presume obtained idea reflection reason dont claim proper positive idea positive means nonrelational hylas means doesnt idea represents material substance like conclude exists qualities cant conceived exist without support seems relative notion material substance conceive conceiving relates sensible qualities right tell please relation isnt sufficiently expressed term substratum substance one latin means underneath layer comes latin meaning standing word substratum mean spread sensible qualities true consequently spread extendedness agree nature entirely distinct extendedness tell extendedness quality matter something supports qualities isnt obvious supported thing different supporting one something distinct extendedness including supposed substratum extendedness tell hylas thing spread without extended isnt idea extendedness necessarily included spreading anything suppose spread something else must extendedness distinct extendedness thing spread must consequently every bodily substance substratum extendedness must another extendedness qualifies substratum extendedness must also something spread subsubstratum speak infinity isnt absurd well conflicting said namely substratum something distinct extendedness including yes philonous misunderstand dont mean matter spread crude literal sense extension word substratum used express general thing substance well let us examine relation implied term substance relation standing qualities doesnt thing extended stand support another yes isnt supposition infected absurdity previous one still take things strict literal sense isnt fair philonous dont want force meaning onto words free explain please please make understand something tell matter supports stands accidents legs support body literal sense please let know sense literal literal understand inhow long must wait answer hylas dont know say thought understood well enough meant matters supporting qualities think less understand short find dont know anything seems idea either positive relative matter dont know relation qualities admit yet said couldnt conceive real existence qualities without conceiving time material support amounted saying conceive real existence qualities also conceive something cant conceive wrong admit still fear fallacy let try occurred led error treating quality grant quality exist outside mind colour cant exist without extension shape exist without sensible quality number qualities united blended together constitute entire sensible thing obstacle supposing thingsthat collections qualitiescan exist outside mind joking hylas bad memory indeed go qualities name one another argumentsor rather concessionsnowhere tended prove secondary qualities dont exist outside mind isolation point rather secondary qualities dont exist outside mind true existinginisolation come discussion discussing shape motion concluded couldnt exist outside mind impossible even thought separate secondary qualities conceive existing wasnt argument used occasion however like set aside whole conversation counting nothing willing let whole debate settled follows conceive possible mixture combination qualities sensible object whatever exist outside mind grant actually test point soon decided easier conceive tree house existing independently unperceived mind whatsoever conceive existing way right tell hylas see thing time unseen would contradiction great contradiction talk conceiving thing unconceived tree house therefore think conceived could otherwise conceived surely mind without question conceived mind led say conceived house tree existing independently minds whatsoever oversight admit give moment think led wasi realize reflectionan amusing mistake thinking tree solitary place nobody see thought conceiving tree existing unperceived unthought overlooking fact conceived plainly see form ideas mind conceive thoughts idea tree house mountain far proving conceive existing minds spirits agree cant conceive corporeal sensible thing exist otherwise mind yet earnestly contend truth something cant even conceive admit dont know think still doubts isnt certain see things distance dont perceive stars moon example long way away isnt say obvious senses dont dreams also perceive objects like dont appear way distant conclude apparitions dream outside mind means ought conclude sensible objects seen awake outside mind appearance manner perceive admit doesnt visual sense deceive cases telling sensible objects distance really means neither eyesight reason inform idea thing immediately perceive actually exists outside mind eyesight know affected certain sensations light colours etc wont say outside mind true dont think eyesight makes suggestion outerness distance approach distant object visible size shape keep changing appear distances continual change sight doesnt suggest way inform visible object immediately perceive exists distance perceived move forward continued series visible objects succeeding whole time approach agree still know seeing object object shall see gone certain distancenever mind whether exactly object something distance still suggested dear hylas think little tell whether anything ideas actually perceive sight experience learned infer accordance general rules nature ideas experience succession time motion upon whole think thats comes isnt obvious man born blind suddenly enabled see would start experience may suggested sight would according notion distance linked things saw would take latter new set sensations existing mind undeniable make still plain isnt distance line running eye line situated perceived sight cannot doesnt follow distance isnt strictly immediately perceived sight seems think colours distance acknowledge mind dont colours appear eye coexisting place extension shape conclude deliverances sight shapes exist outside mind agree colours dont sensible appearances dont know answer even distance truly immediately perceived mind still wouldnt follow existed mind whatever immediately perceived idea idea exist mind would absurd suppose tell philonous perceive know nothing except ideas set aside may know rational deducing causes effects irrelevant enquiry senses best judge whether perceive anything dont immediately perceive ask things immediately perceive anything sensations ideas course conversation declared two points latest question seems indicate changed mind tell truth philonous think two kinds objects one kind perceived immediately called ideas kind real things external objects perceived mediation ideas resemble represent grant ideas dont exist outside

substance skillful changing subject philonous see dont want push direction lets return distinction sensation object understand correctly hold every perception two things one action mind true action cant exist belong unthinking thing whatever else involved perception may position perception without act mind perception could exist unthinking substance grant impossible perception mind said active produces puts end changes anything mind produce discontinue change anything way except act cannot mind count active perceptions extent volition included pluck flower active handmovement arose volition

hah anything visible perceive sight perceive anything senses dont perceive immediately often say tell bear hylas tell yet whether anything immediately perceived senses sensible qualities know asserted nothing want know whether still think corporeal substance either sensible quality made sensible qualities question ask ever thought ask say visible object colour see imply either visible objects sensible qualities else something sensible qualities perceived sight earlier agreed false still think left thesis visible objects sensible qualities conversation taking visible objects corporeal substances reach conclusion corporeal substances nothing sensible qualities may draw many absurd consequences please try entangle plainest things never persuade senses clearly understand meaning wish

rather think clouds nothing dark mist vapour must admit philonous colours arent really clouds seem distance apparent colours apparent call distinguish apparent colours real ones easily colour appears distance vanishes one comes closer merely apparent suppose real colours ones revealed looking carefully close right closest careful way looking use microscope naked eye microscope course microscope

really naturally colours objects contrive artificial ways alter make vanish obviously inferred concessions think colours see naked eyes apparentlike cloudssince vanish one looks closely accurately one microscope anticipate next objection ask whether real natural state object revealed better sharp piercing sight one less sharp former without doubt isnt plain science optics microscopes make sight

genuine real perceived way admit theres something say besides possible clearly true actually animals whose eyes naturally formed perceive things small us see think inconceivably small animals perceive microscopes must suppose totally blind see dont suppose sight use preserving bodies injuries eyesight animals use isnt obvious must see particles smaller bodies present vastly different view object view strikes senses even eyes dont always represent objects us way everyone knows someone suffering jaundice things seem yellow isnt highly probable animals whose eyes see differently structured whose bodily fluids unlike dont see colours every object shouldnt seem follow colours equally apparent none ones see really outer object put past doubt consider following colours real properties qualities

alteration thing indeed even factors remain unaltered objects present different colours eye depending angle looked thing happens view object different brightnesses light everyone knows bodies appear differently coloured candlelight daylight add facts experience prism separates different rays light thereby alters colour object causing whitest object appear deep blue red naked eye tell whether still think body true real colour inhering think want know particular distance orientation object special condition eye intensity kind light needed discovering true colour distinguishing apparent ones

furthermore colours external objects could possibly perceive external body affects mind unless acts first senseorgans action bodies motion cant communicated except collisions distant object cant act

colours light since take light corporeal substance external mind light colours immediately perceived us cannot exist outside mind admit motions arrangements certain insensible particles matter colours ordinary sensethat understood immediate objects sightcannot substance doesnt perceive say well give position regards sensible qualities mankind takes colours think like scientists invisible colours business argue suggest consider whether wise discussion like one affirm red blue see real colours certain unknown motions shapes man ever could see real colours arent shocking notions arent open many ridiculous inferences give case sounds admit philonous cant keep longer colours sounds tastesin word termed secondary qualitieshave existence outside mind granting dont take anything away reality matter external objects various philosophers maintain secondary qualities yet far denying matter context philosophers means philosophers scientists make clearer philosophers divide sensible qualities primary secondary primary qualities extendedness shape solidity gravity motion rest hold really exist bodies secondary qualities sensible qualities arent primary philosophers assert merely sensations

outer object material substance animals good reason think shape extension see feel outer object surely think tell hylas think senses given animals preservation wellbeing life given men end dont doubt use animals mustnt senses enable perceive limbs perceive bodies capable harming certainly tiny insect therefore must supposed see foot things size even smaller seeing bodies considerable size even though see themif allonly many visible points cant deny creatures even smaller insect seem even bigger something hardly pick small appear like huge mountain extremely tiny animal agree single thing different sizes time would absurd think said follows true size insects foot size see size insect sees sizes seen animals even smaller say principles led absurdity seem difficulty another point didnt

therefore arent sensible thought settled point admit excuse seem little embarrassed trouble quitting earlier views may help consider point extendedness admitted existence outside mind must granted motion solidity gravity since obviously presuppose extendedness superfluous enquire separately denying extendedness denied real existence right philonous wonder philosophers deny secondary qualities real existence yet attribute primary qualities theres difference accounted isnt business account every opinion philosophers many possible explanations one philosophers influenced fact pleasure pain

therefore arent sensible thought settled point admit excuse seem little embarrassed trouble quitting earlier views may help consider point extendedness admitted existence outside mind must granted
